Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Overview
--------

This subject deals with both chemical thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. The material that will be covered in this subject is intended to provide you with the tools and understanding to handle basic problems involving chemical systems at equilibrium and rates of simple chemical reactions.

Examinations
------------

There will be three one-hour examinations during the term and a final examination. The exams will be closed-notes and closed-book unless otherwise announced. Tutorial reviews will be held prior to each exam.

Homework
--------

Problems will be assigned every week. Late problem sets are not accepted. Homework will be graded by the recitation instructor and returned in recitation.

Grading
-------

Grades for the subject will be based on a total of 600 points:
